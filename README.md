## ‚ö†Ô∏è Compatibility Warning
**IMPORTANT**: This project is designed for Chrome versions prior to Chrome 127. Starting with Chrome 127 (released in July 2024), Google implemented App-Bound Encryption (ABE) which prevents external applications from directly accessing and decrypting Chrome's sensitive data.

For newer Chrome versions, you would need to:
1. Use process injection techniques to access the encryption key from within Chrome's process context
2. Utilize Chrome's IElevator COM service to decrypt the data
3. Handle the new encryption format and storage methods

The sample code provided in this repository works only with Chrome versions 126 and earlier.

## üìã Features
- **Retrieve Browser Data**: Fetch login data from the browser's SQLite database.
- **Decrypt Passwords**: Use Windows Cryptography API to decrypt stored passwords.
- **Display Data**: Show URL, username, and decrypted password in a `TListView`.
- **Clear Existing Items**: Automatically clears the `ListView` before loading new items.

## üîç Overview
- **Button1Click**: Handles data retrieval, decryption, and populating the `ListView`.
- **FormResize**: Repaints the `ListView` when the form is resized.
- **dpApiUnprotectData**: Utilizes the Windows Cryptography API to decrypt sensitive data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- **Delphi RAD Studio**
